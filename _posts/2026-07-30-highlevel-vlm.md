# HighLevel VLM Training

## Goal

Train a high-level VLM with generalization capabilities, building task decomposition and state monitoring abilities for long-horizon manipulation tasks.

## Data

HighLevel VLM is fundamentally a next-token-prediction paradigm for embodied scene understanding, so the data falls into three major categories:

> General Visual VQA Data
>
> Embodied Reasoning VQA
>
> Subtask Decomposition & State Monitoring Related Data

### Data Categories

#### General Visual VQA

General Visual VQA data refers to the generic data required for VLM fine-tuning, such as caption, grounding, and OCR. This category of data helps maintain the pre-trained checkpoint's visual understanding capability and prevents catastrophic forgetting during subsequent VLM fine-tuning.

This data is available in sufficient volume; at training time we only need to sample 10%–20% of the total training set. Currently we are using Cambrian737k.

#### Embodied Reasoning VQA

Embodied Reasoning VQA is designed to improve embodied reasoning abilities, covering dimensions such as affordance, pointing, physical commonsense, success detection, failure recovery, and more. This data contributes to both task decomposition and state monitoring capabilities.

| Dataset Name | # VQA Samples | Visual Input | Dimension Classification | Format Conversion | Training | Other Issues |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EO-Data1.5M | 1.5M | Images | Yes | Yes | Yes | 0.3M samples contain interleaved-action data and are unusable; image resolution is low |
| RoboVQA | 508K | Video | Yes | Yes | Yes | The same video may have questions of different categories |
| ShareRobot | 616K | Image sequences | Yes | Yes | Yes | All visual data are ImageLists (avg. 10 images per question) |
| EgoIT-99K | 99K | Video or images | No | Yes | No | — |
| Magma | 8.3M | Video or images | No | No | No | Focuses on Mark; no language annotations |
| Robo2VLM-1 | 685K | images | No | No | No | Reasoning with trajectory or marker |
| RoboInter-VQA | 928K | images | Yes | Yes | No | Planning data included |



> "Format Conversion" means whether the original heterogeneous formats have been converted to the standard JSONL data format locally.

#### Subtask Decomposition & State Monitoring Related Data

Task specific data refers to egocentric, UMI, and robot data that contains subtask annotations. This data requires secondary processing on top of the original source data to produce subtask decomposition and state monitoring training samples.

| Data Source | Scale | Visual Input | Sampling Strategy | Data Type | Processed | Training | Other Issues |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AgiBotWorld-Beta | 1M episodes | Video | Sample 10 episodes per task | Robot | Yes | Yes | Only 217 unique tasks; deduplication needed |
| genrobot | 1.1M subtasks / 2190 hrs | Fisheye Tri-view Video | Scene-balanced sampling | UMI | Yes | Yes | both open-soure and close-source |
| EgoExo4D | — | Video | — | Egocentric | Yes | No | — |
| Ego4D | — | Video | — | Egocentric | Yes | No | — |
| Xperience | — | Video | — | Egocentric | No | No | — |
| egoverse | — | Video | — | Egocentric | No | No | — |
| egolive | — | Dual-view Video | — | Egocentric | No | No | close-source |

### Annotation Method

As shown below, within ±200 ms of each subtask boundary, we define a **Transition Phase**; all other regions are **Execution Phase**.

N frames (currently 5) are randomly sampled from each phase and annotated with VQA.

```diagram
                                                       ░░ Transition Phase   ██ Execution Phase

### VQA Annotation Format

#### Task Decomposition

```python
vqa_item = {
    "id": file_id,
    "image": image_paths,
    "source_mcap": source_mcap,
    "conversations": [
        {
            "from": "human",
            "value": (
                "<image>\n<image>\n<image>\n"
                "The observations are captured from ego view, left_wrist view and right_wrist view. "
                "Given previous <MeM>.In order to finish the task:{task} What should the robot do?"
            )
        },
        {
            "from": "gpt",
            "value": {subtask}
        }
    ]
}
```

#### State Monitoring

```python
vqa_item = {
    "id": file_id,
    "image": image_paths,
    "source_mcap": source_mcap,
    "conversations": [
        {
            "from": "human",
            "value": (
                "<image>\n<image>\n"
                "The two images represent the start of {subtask} observation and current observation "
                "from ego view respectively. What is the progress of {subtask} now?"
            )
        },
        {
            "from": "gpt",
            "value": "done or ongoing" or "0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, 80-100% as special token"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Model Fine-tuning

### QWEN3

Currently using Qwen3-4B for VQA LoRA fine-tuning, with validation on the ERIQ benchmark.

- https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-VL/tree/main/qwen-vl-finetune
- https://github.com/GenieReasoner/ERIQ

### QWEN3.5

The official Qwen GitHub fine-tuning code only supports up to QWEN3. Fine-tuning QWEN3.5 requires switching to ms-swift.

## Online Inference Loop
Prompt VLM with task decomposition and subtask progress monitor asynchronously: task decomposition predicts next subtask only when the previous subtask is finished.   
### Two situations should be treated specially
At the beginning of the task, task decomposition predicts subtask directly because no previous subtask is performed.   
Task finished should also be predicted when all subtasks are finished and the goal of overall task is satisfied.   

## Challenges

Subtask decomposition and progress understanding rely on context. The key problem is: how to inject context / memory into the model efficiently without hacks. We can use agent as a memory component to produce necessary memory.
